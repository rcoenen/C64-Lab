# C64-Lab

**Open-source Commodore 64 development tools and demos for modern cross-platform workflows (2026)**

A collection of reference projects demonstrating how to create C64 software using contemporary cross-development toolchains. Built through "vibe coding" - developed iteratively with AI assistance, focusing on modern authoring workflows: open-source cross-platform tools, and AI pair programming.

Historically, C64 development was Windows-centric with proprietary tools. In 2026, these projects use open-source toolchains that work equally well on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The goal is to show that you can build real C64 productions on any modern computer without deep 6502 expertise.

## Repository Structure

### [Demos](demos/)
C64 demo productions showcasing classic effects: color fading, stable rasters, trackloading, and more. Each includes complete source code and build scripts.

### [Tools](tools/)
Cross-development utilities for C64 production, including image format converters and build tooling.

## Quick Start

Requires [VICE](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/) emulator (available for macOS, Linux, and Windows). Projects use open-source cross-platform tools. See individual project READMEs for build instructions and specific requirements.

## Philosophy

These projects prioritize:
- **Accessibility** - Get started without years of 6502 experience
- **Cross-platform** - Build on macOS, Linux, or Windows using open-source tools
- **Documentation** - Understand what the code does and why
- **Open source** - Learn from and build upon these examples
