# C64-Lab

**Open-source Commodore 64 development tools and demos for modern macOS workflows (2026)**

A collection of reference projects demonstrating how to create C64 software using contemporary cross-development toolchains. Built through "vibe coding" - developed iteratively with AI assistance, focusing on modern authoring workflows: cross-platform toolchains, open-source tools, and AI pair programming.

The goal is to show that you can build real C64 productions on modern computers without deep 6502 expertise.

## Repository Structure

### [Demos](demos/)
C64 demo productions showcasing classic effects: color fading, stable rasters, trackloading, and more. Each includes complete source code and build scripts.

### [Tools](tools/)
Cross-development utilities for C64 production, including image format converters and build tooling.

## Quick Start

Requires macOS and [VICE](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/) emulator. See individual project READMEs for build instructions and specific requirements.

## Philosophy

These projects prioritize:
- **Accessibility** - Get started without years of 6502 experience
- **Modern tooling** - Cross-compile from macOS, use familiar editors
- **Documentation** - Understand what the code does and why
- **Open source** - Learn from and build upon these examples
